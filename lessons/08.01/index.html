          The bearded dragon can lose its front teeth when trying to grab or tear
          apart their prey. But do not worry because their teeth can grow back.

          Central bearded dragons can grow to about 2 feet long. Half of the length of a bearded dragon's body
          is its tail. Females are usually smaller than males. If a bearded dragon is scared, it will flatten
          its body against the ground, puff out its spiky throat, and open its jaws to make itself look larger.
